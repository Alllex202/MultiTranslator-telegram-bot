Okay, we took to kapandash. Hardly automated part of the work, during which the managers shouted. Now it was not necessary to make all the documents with the help of the handles, but the data were pulled from the CRM, which is so necessary. As a result, the formation of the document took 5 minutes of one manager instead of 3x departments and a week.

And what are you thinking? A howl arose that this should not be done by the manager, but that there should be 3 sections, like and before.

Then a new manager of managers came and made an EDS to the end, finished the internal systems, stopped meeting for 4 hours a day. Suddenly (!) It turned out that you can not sit until one o'clock at night at work or go on weekends. Did you say thank you? No, he was mixed with shit because he interferes with other people's processes.

Self-service is not a panacea. Endless reports and conferences are produced by the name of the leaders, who must show efficiency when they themselves do not have it. And this is not only y us, it is so everywhere. The problem is that in the presence of an intended goal, people do not need a leadership, or just one big leader is enough. The layer, which reads in cyclones in the winter and goes to the BMB, out of the blue (!), Is not necessary. And that is why she will be against any attempts at automation, but not simple workers who will always be found.

Хроническая пневмония всë детство - это одиночество.

Вместо беготни по двору и прыгалок я постоянно сидела дома или больная, или чтобы не простудилась.

Лучшими друзьями моего детства были книги и радиола. Журналы "Колобок" и "Кругозор" снабжали пластинками с песнями, а радио Маяк учило ловить и запоминать на ходу. Вот только петь я могла или на музыкальных занятиях в детском саду, или когда дома совсем никого. Или про себя. Маме не нравился голос, поэтому лучше было молчать, распевач в уме.`;
